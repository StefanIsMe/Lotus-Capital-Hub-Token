## Remix IDE's SOLIDITY STATIC ANALYSIS report:

## Gas & Economy

Gas costs:

- Gas requirement of function `LotusCapitalTestToken.pause` is infinite. If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage).
  - Position: Line 53, Column 4

- Gas requirement of function `LotusCapitalTestToken.unpause` is infinite. If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage (this includes clearing or copying arrays in storage).
  - Position: Line 57, Column 4

## Miscellaneous

Constant/View/Pure functions:

- `LotusCapitalTestToken._beforeTokenTransfer(address,address,uint256)`: Potentially should be constant/view/pure but is not. Note: Modifiers are currently not considered by this static analysis.
  - Position: Line 61, Column 4

Guard conditions:

- Use `assert(x)` if you never ever want `x` to be false, not in any circumstance (apart from a bug in your code). Use `require(x)` if `x` can be false, due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component.
